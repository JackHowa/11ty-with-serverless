# 11ty Scaffold with Serverless

A starting point for an 11ty site. With:

- Nunjucks template inheritance
- Sass pipeline with SCSS
- Responsive breakpoints via mixins
- Image passthrough without optimisation
- 11ty data cascade with remote data request
- Serverles functions pipeline with [Netlify Functions](https://netlify.com/functions)


## Using this scaffold

You can use this repo as a Template via GitHub, or fork it, but it is intended to be used via [11up](https://www.npmjs.com/package/11up) - a little utility for remotely copying scaffolds like this as a quick way to start a new 11ty site.

```bash
# install via 11up
npx 11up@latest

# ...select "scaffold-plus-serverless" from the available templates when prompted
```
